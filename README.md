Business site
This weeks project was to create a business site with a header containing a hero image/clip, a fill in form and an accordion.

The problem
I found clips that I put in the header, styled after tips from a youtube video discussin the topic. I proceeded with the accordion where I got tips from W3 and youtube. The form was created from the videoclip by Damian and w3. I started mobile first, created a grid in tablet and desktop size.

If I had more time I would fix the hero clip not being responsive above 1200px or so and the radiobuttons made in flex being responsive and expanding all the way. I couldn't make the container they were in stop at a max width.

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
